# Excited for art?!

Grab your bob ross wigs! I don't really trust the hotel wifi. If you're able please ensure your terminal is ready to go and you're able to follow these instructions. You'll be drawing happy little circles in no time.

In this session you'll be making art using the basic HTML Canvas, vanilla javascript, and some helper utils.

# Nice to have before we start

We'll be using the terminal a bit for this breakout. I've written a small checklist to go through. Internet won't be the best at the hotel so let's get this out of the way ahead of time.

Make you you have a recent version of node/npm installed. You need node 8+ and npm 5+

```
npm --version
node --version
```

```
npm i canvas-sketch-cli -g
```

## Setting up our enviornment

Let's also pre set up a working enviornment and download the dependencies we'll use.

```
mkdir ~/generative-art-breakout && cd ~/generative-art-breakout
canvas-sketch sketch/workshop.js --new
```

In the terminal you should see a local host and ip address, go here in your browser and you should see a white page with a box in the middle.
